## Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a portfolio using React, as a web developer, to showcase my work and collaborate with other developers in the community. The portfolio will utilize the latest technologies to stand out from other developers' portfolios and will be deployed on GitHub Pages. To ensure the project's success, the codebase will be pushed to the default branch in GitHub and the gh-pages branch will be used to host the deployed application's build, following the instructions in the Git Guide or the Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages.


## Implementation

- Developed a single-page application portfolio using React to showcase work samples as a web developer.
- Included a header, a content section, and a footer on the portfolio page.
- Included navigation titles such as About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume in the header for easy access to different sections of the portfolio.
- Highlighted the title corresponding to the current section of the portfolio and presented the corresponding section without reloading the page when a navigation title is clicked.
- Set the About Me title and section as default when the portfolio page is loaded for the first time.
- Added a recent photo or avatar and a short bio of the developer in the About Me section.
- Included titled images of six applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories in the Portfolio section.
- Added a contact form with fields for name, email address, and message in the Contact section.
- Added form validation to ensure that required fields are filled in and an error message appears if an invalid email address is entered.
- Added a link to download the developer's resume and a list of their proficiencies in the Resume section.
- Added text or icon links to the developer's profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform such as Stack Overflow or Twitter in the footer.
